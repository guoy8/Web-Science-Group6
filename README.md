## What is it?
.wavpool is an interactive sound library that allows users to mix and play sounds to create a unique ambient environment.

Use preloaded sounds or upload your own! Layer and edit multiple sounds to create a new mix that can be saved with a free user account.

Allow the weather feature to find your local weather conditions which will recommend sounds in the opposite nature to put you in a new mood. The page will also style to match the opposite weather conditions to allow for complete immersion.
